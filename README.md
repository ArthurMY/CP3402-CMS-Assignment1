### Purpose of the Joomla website & WordPress website and its S.M.A.R.T goals

My Joomla website and WordPress website are providing a platform for board gamers to trade their game cards. 
I hope this website can attract the current board game players and discover some of the potential players. 
Here is the S.M.A.R.T for my website.

* **Specific:** Develop an appealing and informative website that showcases a wide range of board games, provides clear contact information, and offers a user-friendly interface for customers to easily reach out.

* **Achievable:** Ensure that the goals are realistic and attainable within the context of your board game shop:
  * Implement effective marketing strategies, such as social media campaigns and email newsletters, to attract more visitors to the website.
  * Provide prompt and helpful customer service to inquiries to encourage customers to engage and make purchases.
