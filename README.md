## Assignment 1
### Purpose of the Joomla website & WordPress website and its S.M.A.R.T goals

My Joomla website and WordPress website are providing a platform for board gamers to trade their game cards. 
I hope this website can attract the current board game players and discover some of the potential players. 
Here is the S.M.A.R.T for my website.

* **Specific:** Develop an appealing and informative website that showcases a wide range of board games, provides clear contact information, and offers a user-friendly interface for customers to easily reach out.

* **Measurable:** Set measurable goals to track increased engagement and customer contact:
  * Increase the number of inquiries or contact form submissions from customers by 50% within six months after the website launch.
  * Aim to receive positive feedback or testimonials from at least 20% of customers who have used the contact information to inquire about board games within the first year.

* **Achievable:** Ensure that the goals are realistic and attainable within the context of your board game shop:
  * Implement effective marketing strategies, such as social media campaigns and email newsletters, to attract more visitors to the website.
  * Provide prompt and helpful customer service to inquiries to encourage customers to engage and make purchases.

* **Relevant:** Align the website's design and content to motivate customers to take action and make purchases:
  * Create enticing product descriptions, accompanied by high-quality images, to prompt customers to want more information or buy board games.

* **Time-bound:** Set a timeframe to achieve increased engagement and customer contact:

  * Regularly review website analytics to track customer engagement and adjust strategies if necessary to meet the set goals.



## Learning Journey for Assignment 1
### Learning Activities & Resources
For Assignment 1, I took time to build a new Joomla website and study to use WordPress to build a similar website.

To learn how to use Joomla, I watched a tutorial on Youtube. After the tutor learning, I spent two hours designing my own website.
Why I choose AWS to host my website, not Infinityfree, because AWS is able to provide a high-speed connection, and it is under their algorithm protection.

### Estimated hours
I spent 11 hours on this Assignment. The self-learning process does not work really well, it makes me need more time to look for the right material to learn and practice.

### Content Insights
Ponopoly provides a safety environment for all the board game lover to trade their cards. We provided PSA professionals to help board gamers with trading. 

### Learning Insights
During the process of developing the website with Joomla, I found out that is a really easy way to help people who are not familiar with HTML and CSS to build their websites. They can use these kinds of tools to achieve their goals. For the future web development, I think understanding the way to use Joomla is able to save time and make development efficient.
